Ana Maria' Personal Website : /url{https://amfeta99.github.io/}

This website was developed with the aim of sharing a little about my interests and my life/professional path, through my academic and professional experiences, student associations in which I was involved, and projects that I have developed.

The technologies used were HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

As for the next steps of this project, I plan to include more details about my past experiences and add updates whenever I finish a new project.

Disclaimer: This is a work in progress. I'm currently working on making my website responsive to smaller devices.
