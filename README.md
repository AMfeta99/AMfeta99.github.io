Ana Maria' Personal Website : https://amfeta99.github.io/

This website was developed with the aim of sharing a little about my interests and my life/professional path, through my academic and professional experiences, research interests, publications curriculum information and extra activities in which I have been involved. There you will also find my Project Portfolio, including projects and notes on emerging themes. This is a way I found to stay up to date, improve my AI skills (mainly Deep Learning) and develop interesting projects.

The technologies used were HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Please feel free to send me a message to anamariaas.eng@gmail.com if you find any problem. Cheers!

Disclaimer: This is a work in progress. As for the next steps, I plan to add updates whenever I finish a new project.
